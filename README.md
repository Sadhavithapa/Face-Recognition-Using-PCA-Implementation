# Face-Recognition-Using-PCA-Implementation
Face Recognition is one of the most popular and controversial tasks of computer vision. One of the most important milestones is achieved using This approach was first developed by Sirovich and Kirby in 1987 and first used by Turk and Alex Pentland in face classification in 1991. It is easy to implement and thus used in many early face recognition applications. But it has some caveats such as this algorithm required cropped face images with proper light and pose for training. In this article, we will be discussing the implementation of this method in python and sklearn.  We need to first import the scikit-learn library for using the PCA function API that is provided into this library.  The scikit-learn library also provided an API to fetch LFW_peoples dataset. We also required matplotlib to plot faces.
